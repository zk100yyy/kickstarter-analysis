# Analysis of Module 1 Challenge


## 1. Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is based on the [Data/Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/zk100yyy/kickstarter-analysis/blob/resources/resources/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx?raw=true) to find out the relationship of the Outcomes/successful rate with different conditions.

In the first challenge, the condition is  "Launch Date" combined with the "theater" category, from the picture["Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date"](https://github.com/zk100yyy/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/README.md#) we can see different Launch Date would affect successful outcomes.

In the second challenge, the condition is "Goal" combined with the "plays" category. From the picture["Outcomes Based on Goal"](https://github.com/zk100yyy/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/README.md#-1), we could see how Goals would relate to the success rate.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the data we can see theater starting in May would have the most successful outcomes, and Dec would have the lowest successful outcomes. So May has the most successful outcome for theater starters.
### Outcomes Based on Goals
From the data we could see the plays with a Goal of less than $1000 would have the most successful rate, and Goals of $45000 to $49999 have 0 successful rates. So the Plays with Goals less than $1000 would more likely to succeed.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Most challenges would be learning and using Github since it is new to me. Learning Excel is kind of fun for me since I am learning and exploring new stuff. Looking for answers could be a challenge for someone such as how to use "COUNTIFS()".

## 3. Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May has the most successful outcome for theater starters. 
2. Plays with a Goal of less than $1000 would more likely to succeed.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Small/Low budget Plays would more likely succeed. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset is very limited and small, it looks big in Excel, However, 4000 data with a lot of different categories is very limited. When we narrowed the data with conditions, there would not have enough data to support it.
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" I would create a successful rate graph since different months have different staters. higher the outcomes would not mean higher the success rate.
